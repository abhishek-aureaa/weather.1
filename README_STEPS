Prerequisite :
1. Ubuntu 18(desktop version - mean desktop should already be installed).

Commands to build the code : 
1. git clone https://github.com/abhishek-aureaa/weather.git
2. cd weather
3. chmod +x ./build_weather_1.sh
4. sudo dpkg --configure -a
5. ./build_weather_1.sh 
#Build might take upto 1 hour and the Msg should appear on the same linux console "Build Complete!!" 

Good to have already : 
1. curl is https enabled already : command 
#curl -V 
should show https
2.cmake version should greater than or equal to 3. Though the build script will take care of installing it 
command to check version : 
#cmake -version

Commands to run/test application/GUI
1. cd ~/weather
2. ./WeatherApp
1. Enter City in the Edit Box : Enter City Name
2. Press Button : Get Weather Details
3. Press Button : Info
4. Press Button : OK
5. Click Cross(x) - to close window
6. Repeat from Step 1 to 5 for details of another city

Steps to check Full Weahther history :
1. cd ~
2. RUN THIS COMMAND :
cat Weather_HISTORY_DATA.log | more
3. Keep pressing ENTER key to keep moving down the data

Other requirements expected : 
Testing :
1. There seems already existing quite a good unit testing suit. I am still exploring it further.
e.g. ./Weather/to/hunter/root/Base/Source/Sober/Source/sober/network/api/unittest/OpenWeatherMap.cpp
More can be found as :
cd ~/weather
find . | grep -i unit | grep -i test

History Record.
2. I planned to save it in the database(mysql). But could not get time to implement code & hence storing it in the file : Weather_HISTORY_DATA.log - in root directory
3. Weather Forecast : 
Could not get time to implement C++ code for : api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city name},{country code}


Other's Code I used : 
1. https://github.com/ruslo/weather- which internally uses - https://github.com/ruslo/sober
2. http://zetcode.com/gui/gtk2/gtkdialogs
3. URLs referred - Quite a few of them from google, if needed, I can provide.
